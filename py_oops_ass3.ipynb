    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `close()` function is used to close an open file in Python. It is a crucial part of file handling and ensures that the file is properly closed after operations are completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons to Use `close()` and Its Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Releasing System Resources**:\n",
    "   - When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources to manage the file. Closing the file releases these resources, making them available for other processes.\n",
    "   - If files are not closed properly, it can lead to resource leaks, where the system runs out of file handles or other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flushing Data to Disk**:\n",
    "   - The `close()` function ensures that all buffered data is written to the disk. In write or append operations, data may be buffered in memory for performance reasons. Closing the file forces any unwritten data to be flushed from the buffer to the file on disk.\n",
    "   - Without calling `close()`, there is a risk that some of the data may not be saved, leading to data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File Locking and Access**:\n",
    "   - Some operating systems lock files that are being used, preventing other processes or users from modifying them. Closing the file releases the lock, allowing others to access or modify the file.\n",
    "   - This is particularly important in multi-user or multi-process environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consistency and Integrity**:\n",
    "   - Properly closing a file ensures that the file's integrity is maintained. It marks the end of file operations and makes sure that the file's metadata (like file size, modification time) is correctly updated.\n",
    "   - It helps in avoiding file corruption, especially in critical applications where data consistency is paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Using `close()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Opening a file for writing\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing to the file\n",
    "file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Closing the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `with` Statement for Automatic File Closing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a more convenient way to handle files using the `with` statement. When using `with`, the file is automatically closed when the block inside the `with` statement is exited, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example with `with` Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Opening a file using with statement\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    # Writing to the file\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "\n",
    "# No need to explicitly call file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `close()` function is essential for releasing system resources, ensuring data is written to disk, and maintaining file integrity.\n",
    "- It prevents resource leaks and ensures that other processes can access the file.\n",
    "- Using the `with` statement is a best practice as it handles closing the file automatically, making the code cleaner and reducing the risk of errors."

    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Resource Management**:\n",
    "   - The `with` statement ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside the `with` statement is exited, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. This is achieved by the context manager protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Readable and Concise Code**:\n",
    "   - Using the `with` statement makes the code more readable and concise. It clearly indicates the scope of the file operation and eliminates the need for explicit calls to `file.close()`.\n",
