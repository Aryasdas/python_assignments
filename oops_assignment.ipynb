    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class\n",
    "A class in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances of the class) will have. A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Characteristics of a Class:\n",
    "- **Attributes**: These are variables that belong to the class. They represent the state or properties of the class.\n",
    "- **Methods**: These are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors or actions of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class does not hold actual data itself but defines the structure and behavior for objects that are created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. Objects can hold data and methods as defined by their class. Each object can have unique values for the attributes defined by its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Characteristics of an Object:\n",
    "- **Instance**: An object is an instantiation of a class. Each object is an independent entity with its own set of attributes.\n",
    "- **State**: The state of an object is represented by the values of its attributes.\n",
    "- **Behavior**: The behavior of an object is defined by the methods implemented in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a class `Car` that defines the blueprint for car objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a class named Car\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    # Constructor to initialize attributes\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make  # Attribute for the make of the car\n",
    "        self.model = model  # Attribute for the model of the car\n",
    "        self.year = year  # Attribute for the year of the car\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to display car details\n",
    "    def display_details(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Car: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to start the car\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.model} is starting.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object of the Car class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the attributes and methods of the object\n",
    "print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "print(my_car.model)  # Output: Camry\n",
    "print(my_car.year)  # Output: 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car.display_details()  # Output: Car: 2020 Toyota Camry\n",
    "my_car.start()  # Output: The Camry is starting.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**:\n",
    "  - `Car` is the class that defines the blueprint for car objects.\n",
    "  - It has attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`.\n",
    "  - It has methods `display_details` and `start`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object**:\n",
    "  - `my_car` is an object (instance) of the `Car` class.\n",
    "  - The attributes of `my_car` are set to \"Toyota\", \"Camry\", and 2020.\n",
    "  - The methods `display_details` and `start` can be called on `my_car`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the concepts of class and object in OOP. The `Car` class provides the structure, while the `my_car` object holds the specific data and can perform actions as defined by the class."

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting access to certain details and data within an object and exposing only necessary parts. This is achieved by using access modifiers like private, protected, and public to control visibility. Encapsulation helps to protect an objectâ€™s internal state from unintended interference and misuse, promoting modularity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It simplifies interaction with the object by providing a clear and simplified interface. Abstraction allows a programmer to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (called the child or subclass) can inherit properties and methods from another class (called the parent or superclass). It allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. Inheritance promotes the use of shared behavior and attributes, reducing redundancy and improving code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions, with the specific action determined by the exact nature of the situation. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism). It provides flexibility and the ability to extend and maintain code more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encapsulation example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, owner, balance):\n",
    "        self.owner = owner\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount <= self.__balance:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "account = BankAccount(\"Alice\", 1000)\n",
    "account.deposit(500)\n",

    "account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300\n",
    "```\n",

    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "### The `__init__()` Function in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` function is a special method in Python, known as a constructor. It is automatically invoked when a new instance (object) of a class is created. The primary purpose of `__init__()` is to initialize the object's attributes and perform any other necessary setup for the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points about `__init__()`:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: It initializes the object's attributes with the values provided during the creation of the object.\n",
    "2. **First Method**: It is the first method that gets called when an object is instantiated.\n",
    "3. **Optional**: If no `__init__()` method is defined in a class, Python provides a default constructor that doesn't initialize any attributes.\n",
    "4. **Self Parameter**: The first parameter of `__init__()` is always `self`, which refers to the instance being created. This allows `__init__()` to set the attributes on the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a class `Person` that represents a person with attributes like name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    # Define the constructor\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Initialize the name attribute\n",
    "        self.age = age  # Initialize the age attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to display person's details\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the attributes and methods of the instance\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(person1.age)  # Output: 30\n",
    "person1.display_info()  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `Person` with an `__init__()` method.\n",
    "2. **Initialization**: The `__init__()` method takes `name` and `age` as parameters and initializes the corresponding attributes of the `Person` object.\n",
    "3. **Object Creation**: When `person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)` is executed, the `__init__()` method is called with \"Alice\" and 30 as arguments, initializing the `name` and `age` attributes of `person1`.\n",
    "4. **Accessing Attributes**: We access the `name` and `age` attributes of `person1` and call the `display_info()` method to print the person's details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` method ensures that each `Person` object is properly initialized with the provided name and age, setting up the object's state correctly from the moment it is created."

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), especially in Python, `self` is a conventionally used parameter in method definitions within a class. It represents the instance of the class and allows access to the attributes and methods of the class within its methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Reasons for Using `self` in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access to Instance Attributes and Methods**:\n",
    "   - `self` allows each instance of a class to reference its own attributes and methods. Without `self`, it would be impossible to differentiate between instance attributes and local variables within methods.\n",
    "   - For example, when you set `self.attribute = value`, you are setting an attribute specific to that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Context**:\n",
    "   - Methods within a class need to operate on instances of the class. `self` provides the necessary context to know which instance the method is being called on. This ensures that each instance maintains its own state.\n",
    "   - When a method is called on an object, `self` refers to that particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Instance Specific Operations**:\n",
    "   - Using `self`, methods can modify the state of the instance, ensuring that changes are reflected only in that particular instance and not across all instances of the class.\n",
    "   - For instance, `self.counter += 1` increments the counter for the specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explicit is Better than Implicit**:\n",
    "   - Python follows the philosophy that explicit code is better than implicit code. `self` makes it clear that the method or attribute belongs to an instance of the class, promoting readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate the use of `self`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Assign the name attribute to the instance\n",
    "        self.breed = breed  # Assign the breed attribute to the instance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_breed(self):\n",
    "        return self.breed\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of Dog class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", \"Bulldog\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing instance attributes and methods\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(dog1.get_breed())  # Output: Golden Retriever\n",
    "dog1.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog2.name)  # Output: Max\n",
    "print(dog2.get_breed())  # Output: Bulldog\n",
    "dog2.bark()  # Output: Max says Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `__init__` method uses `self` to initialize the attributes `name` and `breed` for each instance of the `Dog` class.\n",
    "- The `bark` and `get_breed` methods use `self` to access the instanceâ€™s `name` and `breed` attributes, respectively.\n",
    "- Each instance (`dog1` and `dog2`) maintains its own state, with `self` ensuring that methods operate on the correct instanceâ€™s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `self`, Python makes it clear which variables and methods belong to the class instance, facilitating better organization and clarity in object-oriented programming."

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
