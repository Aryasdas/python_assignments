    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module in Python stands for Abstract Base Classes. It provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) and is part of the Python standard library. Abstract base classes are used to define common interfaces for a group of related objects, allowing for a more structured and organized approach to object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of the `abc` Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstract Base Classes: ABCs serve as templates for other classes. They cannot be instantiated directly and often include one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass.\n",
    "2. Abstract Methods: These are methods declared in an abstract base class using the `@abstractmethod` decorator. Abstract methods do not contain any implementation and must be overridden in the subclasses.\n",
    "3. Mixin Classes: ABCs can also be used to create mixins, which are classes that provide methods to other classes via multiple inheritance without being intended for instantiation themselves.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Enforcing Interface Contracts**: It ensures that derived classes implement particular methods from the base class, thus maintaining a consistent interface.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstract Class (`Animal`)**:\n",
    "   - The `Animal` class is an abstract class with an abstract method `make_sound`. It cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instantiation Attempt**:\n",
    "   - When we try to create an instance of `Animal`, a `TypeError` is raised. The error message indicates that the class cannot be instantiated because it has abstract methods that need implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concrete Subclass (`Dog`)**:\n",
    "   - The `Dog` class inherits from `Animal` and provides an implementation for the `make_sound` method.\n",
    "   - We can create an instance of `Dog` because it is a concrete class with all methods implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstract classes are meant to define common interfaces and enforce implementation of certain methods in subclasses.\n",
    "- They cannot be instantiated directly because they may contain abstract methods without implementations.\n",
    "- Subclasses that inherit from abstract classes must implement all abstract methods, allowing instances of these subclasses to be created."
